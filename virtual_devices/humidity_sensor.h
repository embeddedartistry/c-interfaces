/** @file humidity_sensor.h
 * Example relative humidity interface.
 *
 * This header defines the core interfaces for a virtual humdity. Two samples
 * are provided:
 *
 * 1. A basic interface for reading humidity (HumiditySensor)
 * 2. An interface expanded with support for callbacks (HumiditySensor_withCb)
 *
 * ## Modifying the Interfaces
 *
 * There are a number of ways you might modify this interface to suit your needs:
 *
 * - Change the type or format of the humidity value
 * - Return the humidity sample, and use a separate function to determine validity
 * - Supporting a purely asynchronous processing model (see barometric_sensor.h or
 *   asynchronous_interface.h for an example)
 *
 * ## Possible Humidity Specifications
 *
 * For data format, we can consider a few options:
 *
 * - Simply return an integral relative humidity (because the application does not care for higher
 *   resolution than that), rounded according to your preferred rounding rules.
 * - Use a float
 * - Use a 32-bit integer with fixed-point format UQ22.10 or UQ16.16
 *   (giving us a range of [0, ~4 million] and resolution of 0.001)
 * - Use a 16-bit integer with fixed-point format UQ7.9 (giving us a range of [0, 128]
 * and resolution of [0.002])

/** Virtual Relative Humidity Sensor Interface
 *
 * A standard interface for a device which can measure relative humidity.
 *
 * This device returns relative humdity, rounded to the nearest whole percentage.
 *
 * ## Fundamental Assumptions
 * - The device produces relative humidity (RH) readings
 * - The device reports RH as a percentage
 * - The reported RH reading will be compensated for ambient temperature
 *   by the implementation if it is required.
 * - The device will indicate whether the current reading is valid or invalid
 *
 * ## Implementation Notes
 *
 * - This interface, at its core, appears to be blocking. However, you can still implement this
 *   interface in a non-blocking way. For example, you could always return the most recent altitude
 *   measurement, while there is another thread (or a timer) that handles updates to that
 *   measurement asynchronously.

/** Virtual Relative Humidity Sensor Interface with Callback Support
 *
 * A standard interface for a device which can measure relative humidity. Interested parties can
 * receive callbacks when new samples are available.
 *
 * This device returns relative humdity, rounded to the nearest whole percentage.
 *
 * ## Fundamental Assumptions
 * - The device produces relative humidity (RH) readings
 * - The device reports RH as a percentage
 * - The device will indicate whether the current reading is valid or invalid
 * - The device will notify interested parties when a new reading is available
 *
 * ## Undesired event assumptions
 * - If an error occurs internally, the virtual device will notify interested parties
 *   by issuing an error callback. The registered parties can take desired action
 *   when this occurs (e.g., attempt recovery, stop querying the sensor).
 *
 * ## Implementation Notes
 *
 * - This interface, at its core, appears to be blocking. However, you can still implement this
 *   interface in a non-blocking way. For example, you could always return the most recent humidity
 *   measurement, while there is another thread that handles updates to that measurement
 *   asynchronously.
 * - Note that the callback registration functions do not support error handling.
 *   We recommend that implementers trigger an assert() or other crash if a callback
 *   cannot be added to a list due to exceeding fixed size constraints.
