/** @file barometric_altimeter.h
 * Example barometric altimeter interface.
 *
 * This header defines the core interfaces for a virtual barometric altimeter.
 * The interface can be expanded in multiple ways. For a useful study in variations, such as the
 * use of callback functions and support for asynchronous processing, see barometric_sensor.h.
 *
 * ## Modifying the Interfaces
 *
 * There are a number of ways you might modify this interface to suit your needs:
 *
 * - Change the type of the altitude parameter (e.g., to a float)
 * - Change the fixed-point format
 * - Return the altitude sample, and use a separate function to determine validity
 * - Using callbacks (see barometric_sensor.h or callback_function.h for an example)
 * - Supporting an asynchronous processing model (see barometric_sensor.h or
 *   asynchronous_interface.h for an example)

/** Virtual Barometric Altimeter Sensor Interface
 *
 * A standard interface for a device which can compute altitude by measuring barometric pressure.
 * This virtual device provides both pressure and altitude measurements.
 *
 * ## Fundamental Assumptions
 *
 * - The device produces barometric altitude readings
 * 	- This device reports barometric altitude in meters
 *    - Altitude will be corrected for Sea Level Pressure. If no value for SLP has been supplied,
 *      calculations will assume 1013.25 hPa.
 * - Altitude will be formatted as a 32-bit fixed-point integer with format Q21.10,
 *   giving a resolution of 0.001 m.
 * - The device will indicate whether the current reading is valid or invalid
 *
 * ## Implementation Notes
 *
 * - This interface, at its core, appears to be blocking. However, you can still implement this
 *   interface in a non-blocking way. For example, you could always return the most recent altitude
 *   measurement, while there is another thread (or a timer) that handles updates to that
 *   measurement asynchronously.
