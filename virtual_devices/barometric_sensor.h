/** @file barometric_sensor.h
 * Example barometric pressure sensor interfaces that also support altitude calculations.
 *
 * This header defines three variations of a barometric sensor:
 * - A simple interface, which only provides the capabilities of reading pressure/altitude
 *   (BarometricSensor).
 * - A variation which supports callbacks (BarometricSensor_withCb).
 * - A variation that supports callbacks and expects to be used in an asynchronous
 *   system (BarometricSensor_asyncWithCb).
 *
 * Note that there are differences in fundamental assumptions and function behaviors
 * across the variations. Even small changes in an interface can impact expected
 * behaviors.
 *
 * ## Modifying the Interfaces
 *
 * There are a number of ways you might modify this interface to suit your needs:
 *
 * - Change the type of the pressure parameter (e.g., to a float)
 * - Change the fixed-point format of the parameter (e.g., to 24.8, giving a wider range
 *   reduced resolution)
 * - Return the pressure sample, and use a separate function to determine validity.
 * - Specifying additional callback parameters
 * - Varying the types of callbacks used
 * - Separating callbacks for altitude and pressure updates
 * - Eliminating the ability to unregister a callback
 * - Supporting only a single callback function (this is primarily a change in
 *   documentation to note the change in assumption)

/** Virtual Barometric Pressure Sensor Interface
 *
 * A standard interface for a device which can measure barometric pressure.
 *
 * This is a simple interface, which only provides the ability to read the current
 * sample.
 *
 * ## Fundamental Assumptions
 *
 * - The device produces barometric pressure readings
 * 	- This device reports barometric pressure in hectopascal (hPa)
 * 	- Pressure will be formatted as a 32-bit fixed-point integer with format UQ22.10,
 *   giving a resolution of 0.001 hPa.
 * - This device produces barometric altitude readings
 * 	- This device will report barometric altitude in meters
 * 	- Altitude will be formatted as a 32-bit fixed-point integer with format Q21.10,
 *   giving a resolution of 0.001 m.
 * 	- Altitude will be corrected for Sea Level Pressure. If no value for SLP has been supplied,
 * calculations will assume 1013.25 hPa.
 * - The device will indicate whether the current sample is valid or invalid
 *
 * - This interface, at its core, appears to be blocking. However, you can still implement this
 *   interface in a non-blocking way. For example, you could always return the most recent altitude
 *   measurement, while there is another thread (or a timer) that handles updates to that
 *   measurement asynchronously.

/** Virtual Barometric Pressure Sensor Interface (with callback support)
 *
 * A standard interface for a device which can measure barometric pressure. In this variant, the
 * readPressure() and readAltitude() functions can be used in the following ways:
 * - Have the caller receive the current sample, and trigger registered callbacks
 * - Have the caller trigger a reading (input parameter == NULL), but only have registered
 *   callbacks receive the data.
 *
 * ## Fundamental Assumptions
 *
 * - The device produces barometric pressure readings
 * 	- This device reports barometric pressure in hectopascal (hPa)

 * - The device will indicate whether the current sample is valid or invalid
 * - The device will notify interested parties when a new valid sample is available.
 *
 * ## Undesired event assumptions
 * - If an error occurs internally, the virtual device will notify interested parties
 *   by issuing an error callback. The registered parties can take desired action
 *   when this occurs (e.g., attempt recovery, stop querying the sensor).
 *
 * ## Implementation Notes
 *
 * - This interface, at its core, appears to be blocking. However, you can still implement this
 *   interface in a non-blocking way. For example, you could always return the most recent pressure
 *   measurement, while there is another thread that handles updates to that measurement
 *   asynchronously.
 * - Note that the callback registration functions do not support error handling.
 *   We recommend that implementers trigger an assert() or other crash if a callback
 *   cannot be added to a list due to exceeding fixed size constraints.

/** Virtual Barometric Pressure Sensor Interface (asynchronous mode)
 *
 * A standard interface for a device which can measure barometric pressure. This interface
 * is intended for use with _asynchronous_ implementations. That is, the readPressure() function
 * cannot be a blocking function, but will instead be expected to enqueue a request to geneate
 * a new pressure sample. The pressure sample, whenver it becomes available, will be passed
 * along to interested parties via the registered callback functions.
 *
 * ## Fundamental Assumptions
 *
 * - The device produces barometric pressure readings
 * 	- This device reports barometric pressure in hectopascal (hPa)
 * 	- Pressure will be formatted as a 32-bit fixed-point integer with format UQ22.10,
 *   giving a resolution of 0.001 hPa.
 * - This device produces barometric altitude readings
 * 	- This device will report barometric altitude in meters
 * 	- Altitude will be formatted as a 32-bit fixed-point integer with format Q21.10,
 *   giving a resolution of 0.001 m.
 * 	- Altitude will be corrected for Sea Level Pressure. If no value for SLP has been supplied,
 * calculations will assume 1013.25 hPa.
 * - readPressure() will be used to request a new pressure sample from the device.
 * - The device will notify interested parties when a new valid sample is available after
 *   a successful readPressure() request has completed.
 *
 * ## Undesired event assumptions
 *
 * - If an error occurs internally, the virtual device will notify interested parties
 *   by issuing an error callback. The registered parties can take desired action
 *   when this occurs (e.g., attempt recovery, stop querying the sensor).
 * - The readPressure() function will provide inidication if the request cannot be made
 *   (e.g., queue full)
 *
 * ## Implementation Notes
 *
 * - readPressure() should be a non-blocking call. It should not directly query the sensor and
 *   wait for a response, but should instead send a request to a queue of some type.
 * - Note that the callback registration functions do not support error handling.
