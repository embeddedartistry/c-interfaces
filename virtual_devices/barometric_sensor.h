/** Virtual Barometric Altitude Sensor Interface
*
* A standard interface for a device which can measure barometric pressure.
*
* This virtual device provides both pressure and altitude measurements.
*
* ## Fundamental Assumptions
*
* - This device produces barometric altitude readings
* - This device will report barometric altitude in meters
* - The device will compute altitude on a configurable value for Sea Level
*   Pressure supplied by the system. If no value is provided, an SLP of
*   1013.25 hPa will be assumed.
* - The device will be properly initialized by the system prior to any
*   module invoking functions provided by this interface.
*/
